### About Us
We are a team of developers and designers committed to creating innovative solutions for justice, security, and gender-based violence (GBV). Our project, **Kirki**, focuses on empowering individuals, communities, and organizations with the tools they need to prevent and address issues related to violence, crime, and insecurity.

### Project Overview
**Kirki** is an integrated platform designed to tackle the lack of accessible resources and support for individuals facing gender-based violence, crime, and insecurity in Kaduna State. Our goal is to create a centralized hub that connects survivors, law enforcement, service providers, and the general public with the resources they need to foster a safer and more just community.

### Problem Statement

There is a need for accessible platforms that provide individuals with tools for preventing and resolving these issues. Kirki aims to address this gap by offering a comprehensive set of features that empower users with information, emergency services, and opportunities for community engagement.

### Our Solution
